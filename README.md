# Password strength analyzer

## About this project
I built this simple command-line password strength analyzer tool. To expand my knowledge in the cybersecurity field. It is a very basic project, but was a first for me. It checks the length, use of uppercase letters, use of lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to analyze the strength of a password. I will be updating this repo as I learn more and implement changes in the code to make it better! :D

## Features
- Checks the strength by:
    1. Length of the password (Always use a password longer than 8 characters to be more secure)
    2. Use of uppercase letters [A-Z]
    3. Use of lowercase letters [a-z]
    4. Use of numbers [0-9]
    5. Use of special characters [!-?]

## Tools used
Being my first time doing something like this I used multiple sources to ensure I am doing it correct. As well as helping me understand what I am doing, along with a bit of stumbling around in the dark.
ChatGPT (Ensuring I understand the code I'm writing)
StackOverflow (Checking any potential errors I encountered to better understand them)
YouTube (Any additional info)

## Installation
To use the analyzer tool, clone the repo and run the python script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Juxtap0se/password_analyzer.git
cd password_strength_analyzer
python password_analyzer.py
